# Graphs
A graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them.

A pair (x,y) is referred to as an edge, which communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex.\

Graphs are used to solve real-life problems that involve representation of the problem space as a network. Examples of networks include telephone networks, circuit networks, social networks (like LinkedIn, Facebook etc.).


## Challenge
the challenge asked us to implement a graph class from scratch by implementing 3 classes 
- vertex 
- edge
- graph
then to write methode that helps me to create a connected graph

## API
 - add node method : that adds a node to the graph & return the added node.

 - add edge method : that adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph.

 - get nodes method : that returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection.

 - get neighbors method : that returns a collection of edges connected to the given node.
 
 - size method : that returns the total number of nodes in the graph.
